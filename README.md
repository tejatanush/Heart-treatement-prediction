# Heart-treatement-prediction  
This model is capable of predicting which type of treatment is required for a person suffering fro heart disease with respective symptoms or features. This helps doctors easier to analyze the disease of patient and to make treatment easily. Patients may also get analysed about their disease and get confidence by observing trends occured for persons who have suffered from respective heart disease earlier.

### Applications  
* Early detection of heart disease risk factors in individuals, allowing for timely intervention and lifestyle modifications.  
* Personalized treatment recommendations based on individual patient data and predictive analytics, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.  
* Integration with wearable devices for continuous monitoring of heart health, enabling real-time feedback and proactive management of cardiovascular conditions.  
* Population-level screening programs leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify high-risk groups and allocate resources efficiently for preventive measures and interventions.  
### Compiler Type:  
I used a compiler CPU provided in google colab while running this project.  
## Results  
### This project contain two models. Among them K-Means clustering model have a davies bouldin score of 0.59 and hierarchical clustering model have a davies bouldin score of 1.02.
